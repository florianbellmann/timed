# timed

CLI Interface to do lightweight superfast timetracking

change to last N entries and configure? not static 50?
its too much anyway

# Ideas

- TDD Approach
- Maybe use a pipeline as a build server with releases?
- 80/20 feature analysis in the beginning

built with a test driven design approach

- command to directly edit and fix timelog in nvim
1) beatify cli(inputs and display)

      // TODO: roadmap: maybe add additional logic that actually calculates time by start and end
      // then also gives hints if a session isnt done yet
