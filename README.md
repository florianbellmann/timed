# timed

CLI Interface to do lightweight superfast timetracking

change to last N entries and configure? not static 50?
its too much anyway

# Ideas

- TDD Approach
- Maybe use a pipeline as a build server with releases?
- 80/20 feature analysis in the beginning

built with a test driven design approach
